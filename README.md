# Lists of everything I learned while building a rock paper scissors project with JavaScript:
**-Data types**: JavaScript data types: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, object
**-Variables**: Variables are used to store data. They can be declared using the var, let, or const keyword.

**-DOM**: The DOM (Document Object Model); used to access and manipulate the document's elements.

**-Objects**: Objects are used to store data. They can be created using the {} curly braces.

**-JSON**

**-Local storage**: Local storage is a way to store data on the user's computer. I used this to store the game's score.
